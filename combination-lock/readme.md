# Combination Lock

## Question
A combination lock has three dials, each dial has eight letters.
In this example we know that the following combinations have been used:
`one`, `who`, `two`, `bob`, `add`, `owl`, `fab`, `den`, `mia`, `tat`.

Write a function that determines whether the new combination can be used or not.
Return `POSSIBLE` if it can be used, and `IMPOSSIBLE` if not.

## Scripts

### `npm install`

Install dependencies we need to test the function.

### `npm test`

Launch the test runner to test the function.
